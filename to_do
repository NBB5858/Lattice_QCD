lattice by lattice, the online thing that changes
is the energy function, and the observables, once the
dimensionality is set. Should have some subclass structure

what is tbb

allow lattice to take in more general structure of observables

give attributes in class better names, they're too long


make the policies structs
why did you put the template header in the policy functions themselves?




Note for the read me

One may notice that there is a lot of repeated code from class to class.
At a glance, this could avoided with a policy-based design and class templates.
e.g., we could have a template for a lattice of generic dimension taking in generic energy policy
and a generic policy for observables.

However, to completely define e.g. the energy policy, it must be aware of the lattice's values
(e.g. in nearest neighbors, we sum over the values adjacent lattice points).  This creates
a very awkward circularity, where the lattice class depends on the energy policy which depends on
the lattice class.  This is tricky to break, and annoying to maintain / debug.

Our solution will just be to repeat code.  Our goal is to make interesting scientific measurements,
not to build good software that no one will use anyway.  We'll view each each class as a separate experiment.
